## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a temperature prediction model for the city of Delhi using Facebook Prophet. The model utilizes weather data from January 1, 2013, to April 24, 2017, to forecast future temperatures.

## Data
The data used for training and testing the model is sourced from a [Kaggle based on the Daily weather data of New Delhi](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data). Please refer to the data source for more detailed information.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python and pip installed.
2. Install dependencies by running the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the `model.ipynb` notebook to see the modeling and evaluation steps.
2. Adjust model parameters in the `model.ipynb` file as per your requirements.
3. Explore prediction results and analysis in the notebook.

## Model
The prediction model utilizes [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), a user-friendly algorithm developed by Facebook for time series forecasting.
